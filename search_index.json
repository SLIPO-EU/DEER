engine has been outsourced to FARADAY-CAGE, a framework that provides\nabstractions for nodes in a directed acyclic graph that represent computation steps on more or\nless homogeneous data structures which are in turn represented by the graphs edges.\nThis kind of graph is called execution graph.\nIt is dynamically built from an RDF specification by use of PF4J's plugin mechanism.\nGraph nodes in FARADAY-CAGE are PF4J extension points, which means that every step in the execution\ngraph is performed by a plugin that is dynamically loaded and automatically parametrized from\nthe RDF configuration.\nFARADAY-CAGE will also automatically parallelize plugins based on the graphs structure.\nDEER itself consists of two modules: deer-core and deer-server.\nThe first is a library that implements a domain model for dataset enrichment on top of FARADAY-CAGE\nwhile the latter provides a CLI that can either run a single configuration or spawn a server to \nsubmit tasks over a RESTful API. In a future release, the API will be accompanied by a web app\nto build configurations graphically in the browser.\nPlugin Types\nDEERs domain model specifies three basic plugin types:\n\nA ModelReader is the only plugin that can be a root node in the execution graph and likewise it\nmust be a root node. It is responsible for reading one RDF dataset from a dedicated source to feed it into \nthe exxecution graph.  \nA ModelWriter can be an intermediary or a leaf node and it will write one RDF dataset to an external channel,\ne.g. a file or a triplestore.  \nAn EnrichmentOperator is an intermediary node that takes one or more RDF datasets as input,\nexecutes arbitrary transformations on them and outputs the result as one or more RDF datasets.\n\n"},"configuring_deer/":{"url":"configuring_deer/","title":"Configuring DEER","keywords":"","body":"Configuring DEER\nDEER is configured using a simple RDF vocabulary.\nIts namespace is http://deer.aksw.org/vocabulary/#.\nThere are just three predefined predicates that DEER inherits from FARADAY-CAGE:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins are associated with unique resources. The default plugins that ship with deer-core live in\nthe deer namespace and have just their class name as local part, e.g.: \n\n\n\n\n\nCustom plugins should be identified by resources outside of the default namespace to prevent\nnaming collisions.\nPlugins define their own configuration vocabulary.

has been outsourced to FARADAY-CAGE, a framework that provides\nabstractions for nodes in a directed acyclic graph that represent computation steps on more or\nless homogeneous data structures which are in turn represented by the graphs edges.\nThis kind of graph is called execution graph.\nIt is dynamically built from an RDF specification by use of PF4J's plugin mechanism.\nGraph nodes in FARADAY-CAGE are PF4J extension points, which means that every step in the execution\ngraph is performed by a plugin that is dynamically loaded and automatically parametrized from\nthe RDF configuration.\nFARADAY-CAGE will also automatically parallelize plugins based on the graphs structure.\nDEER itself consists of two modules: deer-core and  deer-cli.\nThe first is a library that implements a domain model for dataset enrichment on top of FARADAY-CAGE\nwhile the latter provides a CLI that can either run a single configuration or spawn a server to \nsubmit tasks over a RESTful API. In a future release, the API will be accompanied by a web app\nto build configurations graphically in the browser.\nPlugin Types\nDEERs domain model specifies three basic plugin types:\n\nA ModelReader is the only plugin that can be a root node in the execution graph and likewise it\nmust be a root node.

For configure the input dataset(s) for an enrichment operator, use the :hasInput parameter which accepts a list of enrichment nodes. Using the same method, use the :hasOutput for specifying the output dataset(s). Finally, we use the :implementedIn parameter for specifying the name of the Java class, which implement the current enrichment operator. \nFor an example, see the configuration of the filter enrichment operator in the next section, where the :node_geofusion is used as a single input dataset and the :node_writer is used as the single output dataset.\nFilter Enrichment Operator\nThe idea of the filter enrichment operator is to select a specific set of the input dataset triples. Then, the selected set of  triples are generated by the filter operator as its output. The filter enrichment operator define the set of triple to be selected using the single parameter :selectors. Where the :selectors parameter accepts one list of selector types. By selector we mean the triple patterns to be applied to the input dataset. The filter enrichment operator has three basic selectors types. i.e. the :subject, :predicate and :object selectors.\nThe following example configuration demonstrates the configuration of the filter enrichment operator for filtering only the predicates  geo:lat, geo:long, rdfs:label and owl:sameAs. \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix rdfs:  .\n@prefix geo:  .\n@prefix owl:  .\n\n:node_filter\n              :implementedIn     :FilterEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :selectors         (\n                    [ :predicate geo:lat ]\n                    [ :predicate geo:long ]\n                    [ :predicate rdfs:label ]\n                    [ :predicate owl:sameAs ]\n              ) .\n\nLinking Enrichment Operator\nThe idea of the linking enrichment operator is to enrich models with links discovered using LIMES. \nIn addition to the common parameters, the linking enrchment operator accepts the two more parameters of:\n\n:specFile which is a path for LIMES specification file\n:linksPart which is determine which of the \"source\" or \"target\" dataset to be enriched, i.e. which dataset to be the source of the discovered links\n\nIn the following example, the linking enrichment operator is used based on the LIMES configuration file \"limes_specs.xml\" and the source dataset is the one to be enriched.\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_linking\n              :implementedIn     :LinkingEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :specFile          \"limes_specs.xml\" ;\n              :linksPart         \"source\" .\n\nDereferencing Enrichment Operator\nFor datasets which contain similarity properties links (e.g. owl:sameAs), the idea dereferencing enrichment operator is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset by using a content negotiation on HTTP. This process returns a set of triples that need to be filtered for relevant information. In addition to the common parameters, the dereferencing operator uses the  parameter operations, which is a list of the following configurations:\n\n:lookUpPrefix interesting resources from the external dataset\n:dereferencingProperty interesting property to extract from the external dataset \nimportProperty for renaming of the :dereferencingProperty in the output dataset\n\nIn the following example, the dereferencing enrichment operator is used to find dbo:abstract from external dataset of DBpedia and export them using the dcterms:description.\n @prefix :  .\n @prefix dbo:  .\n @prefix dcterms:  .\n\n:dereferencing_dbp\n              :implementedIn    :DereferencingEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput         ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput        ( :node_out ) ;\n              :operations       (\n                    [ :lookUpPrefix \"http://de.dbpedia.org/resource\" ;\n                      :dereferencingProperty dbo:abstract ;\n                      :importProperty dcterms:description ]\n              ) .\n\nNER Enrichment Operator\nThe enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity Recognition (NER) enrichment operator.\nIn the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides details about the NER operator parameters:\n- `:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.\n- `:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.\n- `:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE’s types only. Available types are: `:location` (default value), `:person:`, `:organization`, and `:all` to retrieve the all the previous three types.\n- `:askEndpoint` Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX (setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results). By default this parameter is set to false.\nClone Enrichment Operator\nThe idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the same dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n ≥ 2 output datasets, which are all identical to the input dataset. \nIn the following example, the clone operator is used to make 2 copies of the input dataset from :node_1 into :node_1_clone_1 and :node_1_clone_2\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_clone\n              :implementedIn     :CloneEnrichmentOperator \n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_in_clone_1  :node_in_clone_2) .\n\nMerge Enrichment Operator\nThe idea behind the merge operator is to enable combining datasets. The merge operator takes a set of n ≥ 2 input datasets and merges them into one output dataset containing all the input datasets’ triples. \nIn the following example, the merge operator is used to combine the 2 input datasets of :node_1 and :node_2 into :node_3\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_merge\n              :implementedIn     :MergeEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out) .\n\nGeoFusion Enrichment Operator\nThe idea of the geo-fusion enrichment operator is to merge two or more input datasets into one fused output dataset.\nIn addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:\n\nThe :fusionAction is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties (by default the geo:lat and geo:long), the available fusion actions are:\n\"takeA\" always use geometry from first dataset\n\"takeB\" always use geometry from second dataset\n\"takeAll\" merge all geometries\n\"takeMostDetailed\" use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical length of latitude and longitude values\nThe :mergeOtherStatements parameter is used to enable the merge of all other non geo-spacial properties from all input dataset to the output dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix rdfs:  .\n@prefix geo:  .\n@prefix owl:  .\n\n:node_geofusion\n              :implementedIn     :GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2 ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :fusionAction      \"takeAll\" ;\n              :mergeOtherStatements\n                                 \"true\" .\n\nAuthority Conformation Enrichment Operator\nThe idea of the authority conformation operator is to change a specified source URI authority to a specified target URI authority. In addition to the common parameters, the authority conformation enrichment operator accepts the two basic parameters of :sourceSubjectAuthority and :targetSubjectAuthority for specifying the source and target authorities respectively. \nIn the following example, we use the :sourceSubjectAuthority of http://dbpedia.org and the :targetSubjectAuthority of http://deer.org. Such configuration will change a resource like http://dbpedia.org/Berlin to http://deer.org/Berlin. \n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_a_conf\n              :implementedIn     :AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :sourceSubjectAuthority\n                                 \"http://dbpedia.org\" ;\n              :targetSubjectAuthority\n                                 \"http://deer.org\" .\n\nPredicate Conformation Enrichment Operator\nThe idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source property to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values. In addition to the common parameters, the predicate conformation enrichment operator accepts the basic parameters of :propertyMapping for specifying the :source and :target predicates as a list. \nIn the following example, we use the predicate conformation enrichment operator to change all instances of rdf:label to SKOS:prefLabel. For example, a triple as  dbp:Berlin rdf:label \"Berlin\" to dbp:Berlin skos:prefLabel \"Berlin\". \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix rdf:  .\n@prefix skos:  .\n\n:node_p_conf\n              :implementedIn     :PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :propertyMapping    (\n                    [ :source rdf:label ]\n                    [ :target skos:prefLabel ]\n              ) .\n\n"},"extending_deer/":{"url":"extending_deer/","title":"Extending DEER","keywords":"","body":"Extending DEER\nDEER is built on top of FARADAY-CAGE, which uses the\nplugin system PF4J.This is good news for developers willing to extend DEER with their custom enrichment operators,\nas you do not need to fork and mess with DEER source directly.\nInstead, you just need to follow a few guidelines and implement an easy interface to be ready to\nplug your enrichment operator into DEER.  \nWe define three base interfaces:\n\norg.aksw.deer.DeerPlugin \norg.aksw.deer.ParametrizedDeerPlugin\norg.aksw.deer.learning.SelfConfigurator\n\nand four abstract classes:\n\norg.aksw.deer.enrichments.AbstractEnrichmentOperator\norg.aksw.deer.enrichments.AbstractParametrizedEnrichmentOperator\norg.aksw.deer.io.AbstractModelReader\norg.aksw.deer.io.AbstractModelWriter\n\nYou should always extend the abstract classes and never need to implement the interfaces directly,\nbut they could come in handy when trying to obtain instances programmatically using \norg.aksw.faraday-cage.PluginFactory.\nFor more information on how to extend these classes, please read the Javadoc.
